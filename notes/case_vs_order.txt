ECDC - Case vs Order:

Issues:
- Order itself doesn't capture the full extent of order
	- Follow up orders not considered
- Some case ID's seem to be wrong. See customer: 235450090

Potential solutions:
- Use orders without repeat opportunities
- Go ahead with cases
	- Remove potential errors?
	- Remove all without first/repeat opportunity?
	- Use all:
		- Random selection for json? -> *** Choice for initial modeling ***
		- Multiple rows for json?
		- Aggregate json?
