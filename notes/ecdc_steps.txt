ECDC - steps:

Overall steps:

1. Data, Feature extraction, cleaning, ... etc
	-Main data tables:
		- research.feat2__customer_all_on_order_agg ... Aggregated historic order data
		- datamart.fact_contribution_margin ... CM calculation figures
		- datamart.fact_order ... Order financial info
		- datamart.dim_order ... Order other info

	-Overall steps:
		a. Data Dictionaries for all of the above
		b. Investigate financials to remove all random/uncontrolable elements of CM1
			- redefine problem if better: CM ratio?, Gross Sales?, Adjusted CM1?
			
		c. Extract financial features (and any others that pop into mind)
			- previous order data
			- previous order(s) aggregated data
			- split out by original order data (non repeat orders) as well as by case
		d. Create & Join final modeling table

2. Modeling CM1
	- Define error function(s)
