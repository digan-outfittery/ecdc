ECDC - Alternative metrics to predict:

Background:
- The original problem statement is to model the est. future CM1 for a given customers 'next order' (given that it happens)
- CM1 = Net sales expected - (discount + goodwill + COGS expected)
	- Net sales expected = Net sales before cancellation - (net sales cancelled + net return + net return expected)
	- COGS expected = COGS before cancellation - (COGS cancelled + COGS returned + COGS return expected)

	- Issues:
		- Who cancels sales?
		- How is net return expected?
		- How is goodwill decided/applied?
		- Discount:
			- What about one off discounts?
			- How do discounts bias the overall results? i.e Just predict low CM1 for those with discount & high for those without (historically)
			- Predicting who will get a discount as part of the overall model is pretty tough to do
		- Will CM1 just be biased towards those with largest basket size?
			- Is this even a problem? Are box sizes consistent across orders for given user?



Other potential formulations:
- CM1 ratio
	- cm1/nsb4canc_in_eur
	- Solves the problem of bias towards box size
	- Does this problem need to be solved though?

- CM1 before cancellation:
	- nsb4canc_in_eur - cogb4canc
	- Net sales before cancellation - COGS before cancellation
		- Removes weird biases from discount, goodwill, returns ... etc
		- Ignores returns though which are a core part of the profit/loss

- CM1 before cancellation after returns:
	- (nsb4canc_in_eur - cogb4canc) - (nret_in_eur - cogret)
	- CM1 before cancellation - (net return - COGS return)
		- Incorporates returns and thus gives much better idea of actual profitability of given order/customer
		- Net return expeced could also be included (depending on how it's calculated)

- Predicting values separately:
	- Net Sales
	- Net returns
	- other?

- Need to be able to test them on test data to figure out which is best
	- Ranking error vs ranking by cm1





Error function:
- Official statistic: Kendall rank correlation coefficient
	- O(n**2) though

- estimated (squared) lost cm1:
	- based on top N
	- same as weighted MSE? (weighted by N - rank)
